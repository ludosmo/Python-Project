This project embarks on a comprehensive analysis of currency pairs leveraging mean reversion strategies combined with machine learning techniques. 
Utilizing Python, the study taps into a rich dataset of currency pair prices, incorporating data spanning the last decade. 
Data acquisition is streamlined through APIs from financial data platforms, ensuring real-time and historical data integration. 
The core of this analysis lies in exploring the efficacy of mean reversion trading strategies, which postulate that currency values tend to revert to their historical average over time.
